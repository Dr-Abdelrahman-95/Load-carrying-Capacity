**01- Non-Ensemble (ANN model)**

**How to Run:**

1- Load the MATLAB environment and ensure all required toolboxes are available.

2- Copy the code from 01- Non-Ensemble (ANN model).txt into a new script or function in MATLAB.

3- Prepare your input data as a matrix x1 with appropriate dimensions (Qx7 for Q samples).

4- Call the function myNeuralNetworkFunction(x1) to get the output.

5- Ensure the Train.xlsx and Test.xlsx data are preprocessed according to the modelâ€™s requirements.

**Expected Results:** The function outputs a Qx1 matrix representing the predictions.
